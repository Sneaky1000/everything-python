# Numbers

# Floating point numbers should be avoided if possible because decimals
# such as x.1 or x.3 are not exactly representable in a binary floating point number
print(1.1 * 3) # Output: 3.3000000000000003

# Long decimal numbers are considered to be floats in Python

# Numbers can also be integers such as 1 or 53 or even 54049325 (whole numbers)

# There are also complex numbers such as 2 + 4i but a package called 'cmath' is required

That issue is common with other programming languages but besides this,
numbers are similar to other languages in the way they are used and function.
