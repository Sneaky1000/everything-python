# Numbers

# Floating point numbers should be avoided if possible because decimals
# such as x.1 or x.3 are not exactly representable in a binary floating point number
print(1.1 * 3) # Output: 3.3000000000000003

That issue is common with other programming languages but besides this,
numbers are similar to other languages in the way they are used and function.
