# Functions

# There are several built-in functions which can be found here: https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html
# Some, such as len() and print(), are used often and should be remembered
# Built-in functions take in arguments that are passed and return an output based on the argument passed

# This file will go over the details of the built-in function 'print()'
# All other built-in functions and their details/documentation can be found at the link above
print(len('some string')) # Output: 11 (spaces are counted as a character and thus are added to the calculation)

# print() accepts an unlimited number of arguments separated by a comma
print(1, 2, 3, 'etc') # Output: 1 2 3 etc

# Other notes
# -----------
# 1. print() outputs to the console/terminal
