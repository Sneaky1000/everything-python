# Flow overview

'''
Python sees chunks of code based on indentation, not brackets (ew...).

There are seven major ways that determine the flow of the code in Python
  1. If, elif, else - Runs code based on if conditions are satisfied or not
  2. Match - If statements for more specific statements (switch statements)
  3. While - Repeats code as long as a condition is true
  4. For - Runs code for every item in a container (generally)
  5. Async - Runs code concurrently with other code to execute functions faster (`asyncio` module)
  6. Multithreading - Runs code parallel with other code using threads (`threading` module)
  7. Multiprocessing - Runs code parallel with other code using processes (`multiprocessing` module)
  
Commands like 'break' and 'next' can also be used to have even more control.

This folder will go over the first *four* ways that alter the flow of the code as they are built in and
don't require an external module (even though these modules are built-in and just need to be imported).
