# Extras overview

'''
This section will cover some parts of Python that are useful, but not that common
and more complex than what has already been covered. Topics such as decorators,
error handling, multi-threading, etc, are difficult topics to grasp for new Python
developers and it's highly recommended that one gets more familiar with the basics
before diving into this section.
